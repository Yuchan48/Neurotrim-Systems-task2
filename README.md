# JavaScript Animation

Ball(s) moving on a curved path.

This is a part of the Test Tasks for Internship Candidates at neurotrim Systems.
I have created two patterns, so please check both.

#### Task

Create a simple animation in JavaScript to make the ball move on the screen following some predefined trajectory. You can choose whatever trajectory you want, just be clear about that.

#### folder first

Plain JavaScript.

#### folder second

I used anime.js and SVG path builder(https://codepen.io/anthonydugois/pen/mewdyZ) to create a path.
